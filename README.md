A clone of Tetris made with [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

## Keys

Key|Function
---|--------
**ESC** | exit
**TAB** | pause
:arrow_left: :arrow_down: :arrow_right: or **A**, **S**, **D** | move
:arrow_up: or **W** | rotate
**space** or **return** | fall all the way down
**N** | start a new game

## Installation
You need to have [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.1 installed. This program may or may not work well with other versions of LÖVE.

## Launch
Depending on your system, it may be enough to just double-click the file with a `.love` extension. Otherwise, you may use the command line, in which case you should specify the file with a `.love` extension (or the directory `files`) as an argument to `love`. Here are two examples:

`love tetris-clone/bin/tetris-clone-0.1.0.love`

`love tetris-clone/files`
