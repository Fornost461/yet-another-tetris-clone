## Installation
You need to have [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.1 installed. This program may or may not work well with other versions of LÖVE. You also have to download [one of the files](https://github.com/Fornost461/yet-another-tetris-like-game/releases) with a `.love` extension, or the source code (the `files` directory).

## Launch
Depending on your system, it may be enough to just double-click the file with a `.love` extension. Otherwise, you may use the command line as in the following two examples (replace the path by the appropriate one if necessary):

`love tetris-clone/bin/yet-another-tetris-like-game-0.2.0.love`

`love tetris-clone/files`
