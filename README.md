# tetris-clone
A clone of Tetris made with [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

## Keys
* **ESC** to exit
* **TAB** to pause
* **left**, **right** and **down** arrows or **A**, **S** and **D** to move
* **up** arrow or **W** to rotate
* **space** to fall all the way down at once
* **N** to start a new game

## Installation
You need to have [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.1 installed. This program may or may not work well with other versions of LÖVE.

## Launch
Depending on your system, it may be enough to just double-click the file with a `.love` extension. Otherwise, you may use the command line, in which case you should specify the file with a `.love` extension (or the directory `files`) as an argument to `love`. Here are two examples:

`love tetris-clone/bin/tetris-clone-0.1.0.love`

`love tetris-clone/files`
