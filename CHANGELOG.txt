0.1.0 (2016-07-13)
    added:
        - 3 project description files: CHANGELOG.txt, README.md, LICENSE

        - game box has colored edges
        - ambidextrous and numpad support for the keyboard
        - speed changes with score
        - score decreases with time
        - best score of the current game is kept
        - more timers for a better experience when pressing several keys at once or individually

    changed:
        - score system is cleaner
        - saner defaults for grid position
        - window size and position of the elements within the window

    fixed:
        - color randomization sometimes produced squares of the same color as the background and thus not visible

    code changes:
        - array initialization in frozenSquares moved to Tables module and made more generic
        - the structure of each tetromino was updated so that they can be created without checking if they exceed the frame (except if they are randomly rotated)
        - Strings module removed, because so little is now printed (with the cleaner score system) that it became unused
